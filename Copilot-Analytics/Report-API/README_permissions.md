## 3. Security Notes

- The `Reports.Read.All` permission grants access to organization-wide reporting data, including usage insights.
- Ensure best practices for secure implementation:
  - Keep client credentials (`client_secret`) safe and never expose them in public repositories.
  - Use secure storage solutions like **Azure Key Vault**.
  - Limit access to the app registration and its credentials to authorized personnel only.
